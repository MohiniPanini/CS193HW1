## Assignment

For this assignment, you will be making a basic shell script to make some changes to a file system.  A shell script is a useful tool for running multiple terminal commands sequentially.  For this assignment, all your answers will be placed in the `answers.sh` file.  

**ALL COMMANDS SHOULD BE FROM THE `ORIGIN` DIRECTORY!!!!!**

For instance `mv Hello.java Hello2.java` would not be an acceptable answer for renaming Hello.java to Hello2.java, since there does not exist Hello.java in the `ORIGIN` directory.  Instead, the proper answer would be `mv Programs/Hello.java Programs/Hello2.java`.

**EVERY ANSWER SHOULD ONLY BE A SINGLE COMMAND!!!!!**

#### Task 1

Rename `Homework/MA165/HW2.txt` to `HW1.txt`

#### Task 2

Delete `Memes/Spongebob/money.jpeg` (it wasn't funny enough to make it into the memes folder).

#### Task 3

Delete the `Homework/CS191` directory

#### Task 5

Make a new directory in `Programs` called `C++`

#### Task 6

#### Task 7

Copy the `Programs/Java` directory into the `Homework/CS180` folder, while renaming the new directory `Project_1`

#### Task 9
