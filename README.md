## Assignment

For this assignment, you will be making a basic shell script to make some changes to a file system.  A shell script is a useful tool for running multiple terminal commands sequentially.  For this assignment, all your answers will be placed in the `answers.sh` file.  



**ALL COMMANDS SHOULD BE FROM THE `ORIGIN` DIRECTORY!!!!!**

For instance `mv Hello.java Hello2.java` would not be an acceptable answer for renaming Hello.java to Hello2.java, since there does not exist Hello.java in the `ORIGIN` directory.  Instead, the proper answer would be `mv Programs/Hello.java Programs/Hello2.java`.



**EVERY ANSWER SHOULD ONLY BE A SINGLE COMMAND!!!!!**

#### Task 1

Rename `Homework/MA165/HW2.txt` to `HW1.txt`





#### Task 2

Make a new directory in `Programs` called `C++`

#### 

#### Task 3

Move `Programs/Age.cpp` to the newly created `C++` directory made in Task 2.  



#### Task 4

Copy `Programs/Hello.java` and `Programs/Purdue.java` to `Homework/Java`
